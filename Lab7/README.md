Lab7: Asynchronous Elephant

matrix_gen - program that generates matrix of size given in argv[1]
matrix_add- this adds scalar to matrix and save it to matrix_file2.size
it reads the input from file matrix_file1.size using aio_read using redirection operator and writes to another file matrix_file2.size using aio_write after performing matrix addition.

Noe: matrix_gen works fine , but matrix_add is not giving output matrix to file )
